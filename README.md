# excel-date-time-conversion
Imagine an Excel file that contains multiple sheets but the date column in each field is not assigned the date format. When such a variable is imported within Stata, it is shown as a number with decimals. When we assign a date format in Stata on such a number, it ends up either not converting or displays an incorrect date/time.
